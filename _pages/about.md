Hi! I'm a secondary school student from London, and I'm excited to share my love for mathematics and computer science with you. This website is my humble corner of the internet where I showcase some of the projects I've worked on and share my thoughts through technical blog posts and personal journal entries.

As I journey through this path of learning, I am open to connecting with individuals who share a sincere curiosity for these disciplines, encompassing computer science, mathematics, and various other captivating subjects. Building a community of like-minded explorers is something I genuinely look forward to.
